This project attempts to model the morphology of the Persian language using the [FOMA finite-state toolkit](https://code.google.com/p/foma/) which is based on Kimmo Koskenniemi's computational model called "two-level morphology". 

The FOMA files and the scripts written here should be placed in the same directory.
